# Components

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.14.

Inside this project, you find some use common components used in the development of 
GCBA frontend projects.

The idea it's to have some projects, with functionality and style, that represent 
to GCBA's firm  and comply with the UX.

## Development

* All dependencies of the project must be installed in the root project and then added
manually inside this `package.json` as a "peerDependencies"

* We have to increment the `package.json` version for every published version.

* Don't forget tests!!!

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project components` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project components`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project components` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build components` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build components`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/components` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test components` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
